## Project Overview

The Spring Boot project serves as the backend for the healthcare management system. It provides the necessary APIs and business logic to handle various functionalities such as managing patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and medical test results. The project follows a RESTful architecture to enable seamless communication with the frontend.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and frameworks were used in the development of this project:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL (or any other database of your choice)
- Maven

The combination of these technologies ensures a robust and efficient backend implementation for the healthcare management system.

## Installation

To set up and run the Spring Boot project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java JDK installed. If not, download and install it from the official website.
3. Set up a MySQL database and create a new database for the project.
4. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file, located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
6. Run the following command to build the project:
 ```shell
   mvn clean install
 ```
7. After a successful build, run the following command to start the application:

 ```shell
  	mvn spring-boot:run
 ```
 
8. The Spring Boot application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the Spring Boot application is up and running, it will serve as the backend for the Angular frontend. The frontend will communicate with the backend APIs to perform various actions such as creating and retrieving patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and medical test results.

To integrate this backend with the Angular frontend, follow the instructions provided in the frontend project's documentation.
